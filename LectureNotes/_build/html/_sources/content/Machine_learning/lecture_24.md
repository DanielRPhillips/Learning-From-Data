## Stepping through a Bayesian neural network notebook

We return to [](/notebooks/Machine_learning/Bayesian_neural_networks_tif285.ipynb).
Note that Mini-project-IIIb involves playing with and interpreting [](/notebooks/Machine_learning/demo-Bayesian_neural_networks_tif285.ipynb).

Basic neural network
* each neuron has input $\xvec = \{x_i\}, i=1,\ldots,
