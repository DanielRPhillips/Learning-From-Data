# Lecture 4: Parameter estimation

## Overview comments

* In general terms, "parameter estimation" in physics means obtaining values for parameters (i.e., constants) that appear in a theoretical model that describes data. (Exceptions exist, of course.)
* Examples:
    * couplings in a Hamiltonian
    * coefficients of a polynomial or exponential model of data
* Conventionally this process is known as "fitting the parameters" and the goal is to find the "best fit" and maybe error bars.
* We will make particular interpretations of these phrases from our Bayesian point of view.
* Plan: set up the problem and look at how familiar ideas like "least-squares fitting" show up from a Bayesian perspective.
* As we proceed, we'll make the case that for physics a Bayesian approach is particular well suited.
