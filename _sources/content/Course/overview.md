# Overview of Learning from Data

These lectures notes are for a course on Bayesian statistics for physicists.

The course introduces a variety of central algorithms and methods essential for performing scientific data analysis using statistical inference and machine learning. Much emphasis is put on practical applications of Bayesian inference in the natural and engineering sciences, i.e. the ability to quantify the strength of inductive inference from facts (such as experimental data) to propositions such as scientific hypotheses and models.

The course is project-based, and the students will be exposed to fundamental research problems through the various projects, with the aim to reproduce state-of-the-art scientific results. The students will use Python as a programming language, with relevant open-source libraries, and will learn to develop and structure computer codes for scientific data analysis projects.

## Teaching philosophy

Based on the idea of learning to swim by being thrown in the water. Some thoughts:

* absorb details as we go through notebooks
* spiral method

This approach can be confusing and sometimes frustrating. But it works and is good training for real-world situations. To get the most out of the course, be sure to:

* ask questions;
* question authority;
* experiment;
* verify everything.

## Moral qualities of the scientist

Adapted from G. Polya, Induction and Analogy in Mathematics, chapter 1, section 4, which is entitled "The Inductive Attitude".

Intellectual courage
: One should be ready to revise any one of our beliefs.

Intellectual honesty
: One should change a belief when there is a compelling reason to do so. To stick to a conjecture clearly contradicted by experience is dishonest. It is also dishonest to ignore information or not to state and criticize all assumptions.

Wise restraint
: One should not change a belief wantonly, without some good reason. Don't just follow fashion. Do not believe anything, but question only what is worth questioning.
